# Lola Helper!
A program that calculates the profits and saves all the daily transactions of a Sari-sari Store.


I made this program to help my Grandmother compute her daily expenses and keep tabs on daily transactions.

The program uses a lightweight database named sqlite3.
There's also an option to export the data to an excel file. It will generate an excel file if there's no excel files available.

modules used:
  1. Tkinter
  2. xlsxwriter
  3. sqlite3
  4. date time


I turned the project into an executable so I can send it to others who requires it.
